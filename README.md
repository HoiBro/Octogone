# Octogone
Octogone is a 2D platformer that is entirely focused around the conservation of momentum and speedrunning.

The game is about Octo, a failed lab experiment, who is escaping his lab using some weird guns they found.

Use the shotgun and grappling hook to blast yourself to victory!

Controls:
- Movement: A and D or left- and right-arrow
- Jumping: Spacebar or up-arrow
- Aiming: Mouse movement

The game currently features 12 levels and is easily edited to create more.


# Technical Stuff
This GitHub repository contains the video game Octogone and its code.

The game has been made in the Godot game engine, so to ensure a smooth editing feel, open the project.godot file in Godot.

A similar warning has been provided at the top of the aforementioned file.

The newest stable download for Godot can be found on https://godotengine.org/

Also this code is in no ways even close to being perfect and we are simply two highschool students working on it, but of course criticism is allowed and can be provided with a simple bug report.

We highly encoure you to do so if you find anything noteworthy!
